    <h1>Jacquline Gazozla Portfolio page!</h1>
        <main>
            <p>This is my website which will have links to website challengs that I completed from the Website <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/home".>Frontend Mentor.</a></p>

            <p>I used this website to give me a refresh on my knowledge with website development because while on the look for a job in this field, I wasnt practicing any of my skills and found myself slowly losing all that was learned. So here this is like hitting one bird with two stones, I build my Portfolio AND practcie my skills in webdevelopment!</p>
            <p>Currently this page is a work in progress because I'm completly new to github, so please be patient as the websties continues to grow and build as I learn and continue the challenges!</p>
